Functions:

1. When the user clicks "File" and then "open" or "command + O", the user can select a directory. If the directory is null, the alerting will show. If there is no ".pdb" and ".pdb.gz" file in the directory, the alerting will show.

2. All the paths of the ".pdb" and ".pdb.gz" files will be stored.

3. All the names of the ".pdb" and ".pdb.gz" files will show in a list on the right. The use can choose from the list.

4.  The text will show on the right, in the title pane with the title "Text Viewer".

5. The program support showing more than one molecule, and the number of the polymers, monomers and atoms will show at the bottom.

6. The protein sequence with three characters show on the bottom with the polymer's ID.

7. The atoms show in the form of spheres, the bonding between atoms show in form of cylinders and the distance threshold is 2. The spheres and cylinders are allowed to turn them on or off, and change the radius of them.

8. There are three different colouring schemes, "By Atoms", "By Amino Acid", "By Structure".

9. When the user choose "Ribbons", the alpha-helices is magenta and beta-strands will show in yellow, and unknown or without the information about secondary structure will show in grey.

10. If the .pdb file with the information about secondary structure, the colour of the atom in "By Structure" and the colour of the ribbons will directly show.
If the .pdb file without the information about secondary structure, the colour of the atom in "By Structure" and the colour of the ribbons are grey. The user can type the entry in the text field on the top right of the program, and then click the button "Load Structure From PDB", then the colour of the atom in "By Structure" and the colour of the ribbons will show.

11. After clicking a ball,
the amino acid info will show in a label and then fade out
the related spheres which belong to a same amino acid will be selected
the letter in the sequence will be selected
in the text view the related text will be highlighted
in the chart for selected data, the pie chart will change.

The user  also can select letters from the sequence.
When shift down, multiple choice is allowed.

12. The user can click in "redo" and "undo" in the menu or use "shift + command + Z" and "command + Z".
The functions can support redo undo:
The checkbox for balls and stickers
The sliders for the radius of balls and stickers
The checkbox for ribbons
The choice for colour

13. When the user clicks and drags the molecule with the mouse, the molecule will rotate. When the user presses the shift-button during dragging, the molecule will continue to rotate until the user presses shift-button after the mouse is already released.

14. In the pane named "Statistical Data Show", there are some charts showing the information of the protein.

15. The user can choose full screen model and dark theme.
The user can search the name of molecule on the top of the file list.
